  "description": "The Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the skin temperature of ground. It is mainly a product of albedo, the vegetation cover and the soil moisture. From a climate perspective, LST is important for evaluating land surface and land-atmosphere exchange processes, constraining surface energy budgets and model parameters, and providing observations of surface temperature change both globally and in key regions. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/land-temperature",
