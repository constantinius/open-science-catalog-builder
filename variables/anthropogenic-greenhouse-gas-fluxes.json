  "description": "Global anthropogenic emissions of Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gases) continue to be emitted at an annual rate that is not yet significantly decreasing. The global warming potential of each of the greenhouse gases and their long residence time in the atmosphere are causing increased surface temperature and climate change. The scientific community illustrated with inverse models and data assimilation how consistent the reported inventories and the atmospheric observations are, which is taken up also in few national inventory reports (e.g. UK, Switzerland, Australia). https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/ghg-fluxes",
