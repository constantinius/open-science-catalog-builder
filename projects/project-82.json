    "description": "Design and assess the impact of alternative and innovative techniques not implemented in the Sentinel-3 ground segment (no Inland Water dedicated processing); Transpose results obtained by using Cryosat-2 data processed according to the Sentinel-3 baseline to the Sentinel-3 framework (repeat versus geodesic orbit); Migrate results into an hydrological model evaluating the potential of the Sentinel-3 data to improve hydrological catchment; Produce new datasets, including updated tropospheric corrections.",
