    "description": "Development and validation of inland water circulation models coupled with remote sensing data to better understand the processes involved in these water bodies. The project investigated the potential of the S-2 radiometric data products to constrain hydrodynamic and ecological models of at least three water body types covering as wide a range as possible of eutrophic levels and ecological niches.",
