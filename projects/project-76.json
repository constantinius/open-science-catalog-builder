    "description": "A quality assessment of STREAM runoff estimates has been pursued at multiple pilot basins across the world (5 large basins + multiple sub-basins) characterised by different physiographic/climatic features. In these areas, the model was able to accurately simulate river discharge and total runoff time series. ",
