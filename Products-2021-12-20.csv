4,Planned,4DGreenland,https://4dgreenland.eo4cryo.dk/,Ice Sheet Surface Melt_Greenland_S-1/2,"The duration and areal extent of the Greenland Ice Sheet affected by surface melt processes are important parameters for climate and cryosphere research, and key indicators of a changing Arctic climate. Melt processes have a significant impact on the surface energy budget in snow-covered areas, as wet snow has a relatively low albedo in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Moreover, enhanced surface meltwater production has an impact on glacier motion by increasing the internal water pressure. Passive and active microwave data acquired by satellite sensors are the main data sources for products on monitoring melt extent over the ice sheets. Passive microwave data has  been widely used to map and monitor melt zones over the Greenland Ice Sheet. 4DGreenland aims at producing a consistent climate data record on the presence of liquid water and snow properties over Greenland for studying surface melt processes, along with developing methods for homogenizing melt extent products from different sensors.

5,Planned,4DGreenland,https://4dgreenland.eo4cryo.dk/,Extent and volume of hydrological surface features_Greenland_S1/2,"On the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet, meltwater streams, rivers, and lakes constitute a complex and interrelated hydrological network. Rain and meltwater formed on the glacier surface either refreezes in the snowpack is transported as surface runoff to the ocean or enters the englacial and subglacial environments through moulins and crevasses. Moulins develop by hydrofracture and establishes conduits for face-to-bed meltwater transport. This enables surface water to reach the base of the ice sheet, thereby possibly enhancing the ice flow by basal lubrication. An important feature of these open water surfaces at the ice sheet surface is that they alter the surface energy budget through the ice-albedo feedback. The low albedo of liquid water increases the absorption of incoming radiation, which in turn increases melt rates. The low reflectivity and a clear spectral signature in optical wavelengths enable open water features to be discriminated from the ambient ice through optical imagery. 4DGreenland aims at investigating the extent and volume of hydrological surface features with a high temporal resolution covering 2010-present.",https://4dgreenland.eo4cryo.dk/?page_id=49,,,,Ice sheets and ice shelves,2010.0,2020.0,Greenland,"[[[-73.709433726,60.2878324851],[-12.713339976,60.2878324851],[-12.713339976,83.5902211563],[-73.709433726,83.5902211563],[-73.709433726,60.2878324851]]]",Planned,Cryosphere,,,,,,Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2
6,Planned,4DGreenland,https://4dgreenland.eo4cryo.dk/,Ice Sheet subglacial hydrology_Greenland_S1/2,"The movement of glaciers and ice sheets is determined by several factors, with subglacial hydrology playing a major role. Liquid water can enhance ice-sheet flow velocities by basal lubrication and add heat to the ice by cryo-hydrologic warming. The faster motion of the ice sheet induced by basal lubrication will increase frictional heating, leading to a likewise increase in melting, initiating a positive feedback mechanism. Thus, the subglacial hydrology is of great interest. However, basal melt under the Greenland Ice Sheet is inherently difficult to quantify and has been measured directly in only a very few locations (e.g., at ice-core drill sites). Most of our knowledge of basal melt stems from inferred values based on, for example, ice-penetrating radar with reported values spanning orders of magnitude. Progress has been made in distinguishing between wet and frozen conditions at the bed, yet significant disagreement still exists between models and observations, and between different models.  This is problematic because the basal mass budget of Greenland thus remains largely unconstrained. In the 4DGreenland subglacial activity, we will explore the use of Earth Observation datasets for deriving information on the subglacial hydrology to gain insights into its temporal and spatial variations and characteristics. Assessing the ice-sheet scale geothermal heat sources is an essential product hereof.",https://4dgreenland.eo4cryo.dk/?page_id=50,,,,Ice sheets and ice shelves,,,Greenland,"[[[-73.709433726,60.2878324851],[-12.713339976,60.2878324851],[-12.713339976,83.5902211563],[-73.709433726,83.5902211563],[-73.709433726,60.2878324851]]]",Planned,Cryosphere,,,,,,Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2

Full marine carbonate system, calculated from machine learning estimates of total alkalinity (TA) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). The surface-ocean pCO2 presented here is the ensemble mean of 16 two-step clustering-regression machine learning estimates. The ensemble is a combination of eight clustering instances and two regression methods. For the clustering, we use K-means clustering (21 clusters) repeated with different initiations, resulting in slightly different clusters. Two machine learning regression methods are applied to each of these clustering instances. These machine learning methods are feed-forward neural-network (FFNN), and gradient boosted machine using decision trees (GBDT). The average of the ensemble members is used as the final estimate. Further, the standard deviation of the ensemble members is an analog of the uncertainty. The same two-step clustering-regression approach is used to estimate TA. The final estimate is the mean of 16 ensemble members. Each ensemble member has 12 clusters. Support vector regression (SVR) is used as the regression method. Again, the standard deviation of the ensemble members is an analog of the uncertainty. Total alkalinity and pCO2 are then used to solve for the remaining parameters of the marine carbonate system using the PyCO2SYS software. The temperature and salinity products used in this calculation are provided in the file. Phosphate and silicate from the interpolated World Ocean Atlas (2018) product were used. The total scale for pH was used.

The occurrence of a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) can be identified as a rapid increase in the polar temperature (>25 K in a week or less), the reversal of the meridional temperature gradient (T at 90˚N minus T at 60˚N) from negative to positive values, and the reduction or reversal of the zonal mean zonal wind in the stratosphere at 60˚N. An SSW event is called ""major"" when the direction of the zonal mean zonal wind at 60˚N and 10 hPa changes from eastward to westward; otherwise the event is called ""minor"". The ionospheric variability results not only from SSWs but also from solar and magnetospheric sources. The F10.7 index is a proxy for the solar energetic radiation flux into the Earth's upper atmosphere. The Kp index quantifies geomagnetic activity, which is closely related to the activity level of the magnetosphere. Geomagnetic activity is considered to be high when the daily sum of the Kp index is 23 or more.",https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/geomagnetism/projects/archive/vera-vertical-coupling-in-earths-atmosphere-at-mid-and-high-latitudes/#c65013,,,,Geomagnetic Field,2008.0,2018.0,,,2021-04-01 00:00:00,Magnetosphere_Ionosphere,,,,,,SWARM

The monthly product contains 3 months of data on a rolling basis each month and uses the Thematic point product as its input. For example, the January 2020 gridded product will contain point data for a window starting on 1st December 2019 and ending on 29th February 2020.
